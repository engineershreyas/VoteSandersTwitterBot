VoteSandersTwitterBot
=====================

This is a simle TwitterBot written in Go utilizing the [ananconda]("http://www.github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda") library. The goal of this project is to raise awareness of Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign by replying to tweets containing support for issues that Bernie supports such as Women's Rights, Income Inequality, and reform of racial abuse.
